              “Snowball has truly changed our lives. From the first day we
              brought him home, he’s filled our hearts with so much love. He’s
              not just a rabbit, he’s a playful companion who loves attention
              and affection. Watching him hop around and explore our home has
              been such a joy, and he’s always eager to interact with us,
              especially when we’re sitting on the couch or relaxing. Snowball
              has brought a new energy into our house.
